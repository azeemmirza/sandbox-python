 * Array reverse or reverse a array means changing the position of each number of the given array to its opposite position
 * from end, i.e. if a number is at position 1 then its new position will be Array.length,
 * similarly if a number is at position 2 then its new position will be Array.length â€“ 1, and so on.
 *
 * Input: Arr = [1, 2, 3]
 * Output: ArrRev = [3, 2, 1]
